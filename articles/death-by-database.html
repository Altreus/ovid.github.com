        <h1>Death By Database</h1>

        <p>The following is a true story, but with names changed.</p>

        <p>When I work with clients to build software, I take the usual steps
        of understanding their needs, gathering requirements, learning about
        their customers, and so on. At this point I have a model on paper of
        roughly what the software is intended to do, so they get surprised
        when I immediately turn to database design.</p>

        <p>"Who care about database design? What about mockups? What about
        workflows?"</p>

        <p>Let me tell you about "Bob's Luxury Goods." I worked for this
        company many years ago and they had a retail store selling ... you
        guessed it ...  luxury goods. They'd ask all customers for a billing
        address and if they had a different delivery address. At the database
        level, they had a "one-to-many" relationship between customers and
        addresses.</p>
        
        <p>That was their first problem. A customer's partner might come into
        Bob's and order something and if the address was entered correctly it
        would be flagged as "in use" and we had to use a different address or
        <em>deliberately</em> enter a typo. Fortunately, addresses were
        case-sensitive, so many people had UPPER-CASE ADDRESSES.</p>
        
        <p>We should have had a many-to-many relationship between customers
        and addresses so we could handle the case where more than one person
        would share the same address, but we didn't. Further, I was never
        allocated the time to fix the database because it was "cheaper" to
        remove the restriction on "flagged" addresses and allow a
        <em>duplicate</em> address to be used.</p>

        <p>Naturally, being a luxury goods company, we had many repeat
        customers and sometimes they would move and if we didn't find the
        duplicate address, or the address with the "typo", we might update the
        address for one partner, but not the other. That was a headache, but
        it didn't happen frequently enough for management to worry about
        it.</p>

        <p>That's when the marketing department had a brilliant, inexpensive
        idea. You see, we periodically did mass mailings of special events to
        our customers. Since we had the software to do mass mailings, why not
        import a mailing list of all addresses in high net worth areas and
        mail <em>everyone</em> about upcoming special events?</p>

        <p>Except that every address record had the customer id embedded in
        it, so we couldn't enter an address without a customer.</p>

        <p>"Curtis," they said, "just enter a dummy customer called
        'Occupant' and attach all addresses to that."</p>

        <p>Except you couldn't enter a customer without an order.</p>

        <p>Except you couldn't enter an order without at least one item on
        it.</p>

        <p>Except you couldn't enter an item unless it was listed in
        inventory.</p>

        <p>Except that reserved the "inventory" item and made it
        unavailable.</p>

        <p>Except, except, except ...</p>

        <p>It came down to trying to create a fake customer, with a fake
        order, with a fake item, with a fake item category, with a "paid"
        invoice, with exceptions sprinkled throughout the codebase to handle
        all of these special cases and probably more that I no longer
        remember.</p>

        <p>Then, and only then, could I write the code to provide "generic"
        mass mailings. Management decided it was easier to hire an outside
        company to handle the mailing list for them.</p>

        <p>If they had simply had a proper database design up front, they
        could have reused their existing system with little trouble.</p>

        <p>That's what bad database design costs you and why I usually start
        with that before writing my software.</p>

        <p>Note: if you're not familiar with database design, here's a talk I
        give where I make it fairly simple to understand. I mostly avoid big
        words.</p>
