<blockquote>Oracle is the fast, beastly sports car that will quickly
outpace that Honda Accord you're driving ... so long as the sports car has an
expert driver, regular maintenance, and a highly trained pit crew to look
after it.

<p>In the early 2000s, I was working for a company that was using Oracle on
Linux. At the time, this was unusual, though becoming more common. It was
still a time that open source software was often looked upon with mistrust, so
we pointed out to our investors that we used Oracle; we didn't trumpted the
fact that we used Linux.</p>

<p>One day, we discovered a problem. An Oracle <code
class="language-sql">SELECT</code> statement was sometimes returning different
results, even though the underlying data had not changed. The query in
question was extremely complex, but the data should not have changed. So the
company called Oracle and presented the problem. We were informed that while
Oracle could run on Linux, it needed to be Red Hat Advanced Server. Otherwise,
it would not be officially supported.</p>

<p>So we switched to Red Hat Advanced Server. And the bug was still there.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;No, you need be on version X of Red Hat Advanced server.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>So we switched to version X of Red Hat Advanced Server. And the bug was still there.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;No, you need be on version X, point release Y, of Red Hat Advanced server.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>So we switched to version X, point release Y of Red Hat Advanced Server. And the bug was still there.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;That's a known bug. We&rsquo;re working on it.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Words were said. They were not nice words.</p>

<h1><a name="outrunning-the-oracle"></a>Outrunning the Oracle</h1>

<p>In the early 2000s, switching from Oracle to PostgreSQL was a radical
decision. Today, we've have several clients who've wanted to make the switch,
but what holds them back is no longer "can we trust PostgreSQL?", it's "our
entire technology stack assumes Oracle."</p>

<p>And the driver behind the switch? It's invariably Oracle's insane costs with
no clear return on benefit for most companies. Yes, I assume that some
companies find real value with Oracle's ERP solutions, but once you've bought
into that, you have multiple business processes embedded in that world and
backing out is much harder.</p>

<p>But for just using the Oracle database, what does it cost? Hard to say. Oracle
doesn't want to tell you. <a href="https://www.oracle.com/assets/technology-price-list-070617.pdf" target="_blank">I
found a price list for 2019</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, but it clearly states that I cannot
reproduce any of it in whole or part and it's for "education use only."<sup id="1-return"><a href="#1">1</a></sup> The consensus
seems to be that a basic Oracle license will start out at a <em>minimum</em> of $50,000 US
for most companies, easily raising to $500,000 or more, depending on your size
and the options you select.</p>

<p>And that's not counting the cost of an Oracle DBA. Or the support policies. </p>

<p>Regarding support policies, you might <em>think</em> you don't need them, but <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/support/library/057419.pdf" target="_blank">there's
this little catch</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>:</p>

<blockquote>
Customers with unsupported programs are not entitled to download,or
receive updates, maintenance releases, patches, telephone assistance, or
any other technical support services for unsupported programs. CD packs or
programs purchased or downloaded for trial use, use with other supported
programs, or purchased or downloaded as replacement media may not be used to
update any unsupported programs.


</blockquote>

<p>It seems insane that not purchasing a support contract means I can't apply a
security patch, or a critical bugfix, and <a href="https://b-lay.com/software-licensing/oracle-support-how-to-save-costs/" target="_blank">but B-Lay, the license management company confirms this</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.</p>

<p>Oracle DDL is not transaction safe</p>
