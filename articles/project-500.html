<p>Our client had just won a nice contract, but were in a corner: their legacy
system, while powerful, was slow. They could not process more than 39
transactions per second. They needed to get to 500 transactions per second and
they had two weeks to do it. They turned to our company, <a href="https://allaroundtheworld.fr" target="_blank">All Around the World</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, because
we have a proven track record with them.</p>

<p>We had a systems architect, Shawn, and a software architect, Noel, on the
project. Our managing director, Leïla, oversaw the project. I was brought in
because there was simply too much work to do in two weeks.  Fortunately,
though I didn't know the project, I had two very senior architects who knew
the system fairly well to help get me up to speed rapidly.</p>

<p>We had two weeks to improve their performance by an order of magnitude.</p>

<h1><a name="the-constraints"></a>The Constraints</h1>

<p>There were several key constraints we had to consider. Our overriding
consideration was ensuring that PCI-compliance was strictly adhered to to
ensure that customer data was always protected. Second, the client had
developed an in-house ORM (object-relational mapper) many years ago and like
all projects, it grew tremendously. While it was powerful, it was also
extremely slow. Third, because we only had two weeks, we were given permission
to take "shortcuts", where necessary, with the understanding that all work
was to be thoroughly documented and tested, and easy to either merge or
remove, as needed.</p>

<p>Finally, we could change anything we wanted so long as we didn't change the
API, or cause any breaking changes anywhere else in the code. There was no
time to give customers a "heads up" that they would need to make changes.</p>

<h1><a name="hitting-the-ground"></a>Hitting the Ground</h1>

<p>The contract was for a very short online event, so whatever solution we
implemented didn't have to stay up for long. This also meant that whatever
solution we implemented would be disabled quickly if needed. We also knew that
only a few customers would use this new "fast path" solution, and only one
payment provider needed to be supported.</p>

<p>Noel immediately started tracing the full code path through the system,
taking copious notes about any behavior we would need to be aware of. Shawn
was investigating the databases, the servers, the network architecture, and
assessing what additional resources could be brought online and tested in two
weeks.</p>

<p>I, being new to the project, started by taking a full-stack integration
test representing one of these transactions and investigating it to learn the
code and its behavior. In particular, I wanted to better understand the
database behavior as this is often one of the most signficant bottlenecks.
Worse, the client was in the midst of a large migration from Oracle to
PostgreSQL, so making changes at the database level was not an option, so we
needed to know immediately if this was one of the bottlenecks. I wrote code
which would dump out a quick summary of database activity for a block of code.
It looked sort of like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-perl">explain dbitrace(
	name =&gt; 'Full stack transaction request',
	code =&gt; sub { $object-&gt;make_full_request },
);
</code></pre>

<p>The output looked similar to this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-perl">{
  report =&gt; {
    name =&gt; 'Full stack transaction request',
    time =&gt; '3.70091 wallclock secs'
  },
  sql =&gt; {
    delete =&gt; 1,
    insert =&gt; 7,
    select =&gt; 137,
    update =&gt; 32,
    total  =&gt; 177,
  }
}</code></pre>

<p>We had a problem. Even our client was surprised about the amount of
database activity for a single "buy this thing" request.</p>

<p>None of the database activity was particularly slow, but there was a lot of
it. Deadlocks weren't an issue given that the changed data was for the current
request. But the ORM was killing us.</p>

<h2><a name="the-tyranny-of-orms"></a>The Tyranny of ORMs</h2>

<p>In two decades of working with ORMs, I have only once seen an in-house ORM
which was on-par with, or superior to, commercial or open source products. And
it was an ORM optimized for aggregation and reporting, something many ORMs
struggle with.</p>

<p>For this particular ORM, every time a request was made, it would assemble a
bunch of metadata, check permissions, make decisions based on whether or not
it was using Oracle or PostgreSQL, check to see if the data was cached, and
<em>then</em> check to see if the data was in the database. Instantiating
every object was very slow, even if there was no data available. And the code
was instantiating (and throwing away without using) hundreds of these
objects.</p>

<p>To be fair, this is a common problems with ORMs: they're never as fast as
hand-crafted SQL, but they're far easier to update and, when used correctly,
they increase development speed to the point most don't consider going
back.</p>

<p>We considered using a "pre-flight" check to see if the data was there
before instantiating the objects, but there was so much business logic
embedded in the ORM layer that this was not a practical solution. And we
couldn't simply fetch the data directly because, again, the ORM had too much
business logic. We had to reduce the calls to the database.</p>

<p>After an exhaustive analysis, we found out several things.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Some of the calls were for a "dead" part of the system that no one
  really remembered, but was clearly unused.</li>
  <li>Numerous duplicate calls were being made to <em>unchanging</em> data. We
  could cache those objects safely.</li>
  <li>A number of calls were being made for important data, but it wasn't
  relevant to our code path, so we could skip it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our first step at addressing the problem was to ensure that everything was
wrapped in configuration variables that allowed us to easily turn on or off
different code paths for our project. Fortunately, the client had a
system that allowed them to update the configuration data without restarting
the web servers.</p>

<p>Once that was in place, our first pass cut our SQL calls roughly in half,
tremendously sped up the code, and the tests still passed. But we were nowhere
near 500 transaction per second.</p>

<h2><a name="soap"></a>SOAP</h2>

<p>Another serious bottleneck was their SOAP server.  Our client made good use
of WSDL (Web Services Description Language) to help their customers understand
how to create SOAP requests and SOAP was integral to their entire pipeline.
The client would receive a SOAP request, parse it, extract the necessary data,
process that data, create <em>another</em> SOAP request, pass this to backend
servers, which would repeat the process with the new SOAP request.</p>

<p>SOAP stands for "Simple Object Access Protocol." SOAP isn't "objects", and
it's not "simple." It's a huge XML document, with an outer envelope telling
you how to parse the message contents. Reading and writing SOAP is
<em>slow</em>.  Further, our client's SOAP implementation had grown over the
years, with each new version of their SOAP interface starting with
cutting-and-pasting the last version's code into a new module and modifying
that. There were, at the time of the project, 24 versions,<sup id="1-return"><a href="#1">1</a></sup> most of which had heavily duplicated code. To optimize
their SOAP, we were facing a problem. Further investigation found that only
one version would be used for this project, so our client authorized us to skip
updating the other SOAP versions.</p>

<p>We tried several approaches to fine-tuning the SOAP, including replacing
many <code class="language-perl">AUTOLOAD</code> (dynamically generated)
methods with static ones. In Perl, <code class="language-perl">AUTOLOAD</code>
methods are optional "fallback" methods that are used when Perl cannot find a
method of the desired name. However, this means Perl must carefully walk
through inheritance heirarchies to ensure the method requested isn't there
before falling back to <code class="language-perl">AUTOLOAD</code>. This can
add considerable overhead to a request.</p>

<p>Replacing these methods was extremely difficult work because the <code
class="language-perl">AUTOLOAD</code> methods were used heavily, often calling
each other, and  had grown tremendously over the years. Many of them were
extremely dangerous to pick apart due to their very complex logic. We managed
to shave some more time with this approach but stopped before we tackled the
most complicated ones. There was only so much risk we were willing to
take.</p>

<p>Noel, in carefully reading through the SOAP code, also found several code
paths that were slow, but didn't apply to our requests. Unfortunately, we
could not simply skip them because the SOAP code was tightly coupled with
external business logic. Skipping these code paths would invariably break
something else in the codebase. What he discovered is that if we carefully
created a special read-only "request metadata" singleton. Different parts of
the code, when recognizing they were in "web context", could request this
metadata and skip non-essential codepaths. While singletons are generally
frowned upon by experienced developers, we were under time pressure and in
this case, our SOAP code and the code it called could all consult the
singleton to coordinate their activity.</p>

<p>The singleton is one of the many area where deadlines and reality
collide.</p>

<p>We also leveraged that singleton to allow us to extract data on the
front-end, and send it to the back-end directly, without the need to serialize
and deserialize SOAP. Another great performance improvement. Sadly, like many
others, it was specific to this one customer and this one payment
provider.</p>

<h2><a name="tax-server"></a>Tax Server</h2>

<p>By this time, with the above and numerous other fixes in place, we were
ready to do our initial QA runs. We didn't expect to hit our 500 TPS target,
but we were pretty confident we had achieved some major speed gains. And, in
fact, we did have some pretty impressive speed gains, except that periodically
some of our requests would simply halt for several seconds. Due to the
complicated nature of the system, it wasn't immediately clear what was going
on, but we finally tracked this down to the tax server.</p>

<p>Our client was processing credit card transactions and for many of them,
taxes had to be applied. Calculating taxes is complicated enough that there
are companies that provide "tax calculation as a service" and our client was
using one of them. Though the tax service assured us they could handle the
amount of traffic we were sending, they would periodically block. It wasn't
clear if this was a limitation of their test servers that we would hit with
their production servers, but we could not take this chance.</p>

<p>We tried several approaches, including caching of tax amounts, but the
wide diversity of data we relied on to calculate tax meant a high cache miss
rate, not allowing us to solve the problem. Finally, one of our client's
developers who knew the tax system fairly well came up with a great solution.
He convinced the tax service to provide a "one-time" data dump of tax rates
that would not be valid long, but would be valid long enough for our short
event. We could load the data into memory and read it directly and skip the
tax server entirely. Though the resulting code was complicated, it worked, and
our requests no longer halted.</p>

<h2><a name="the-big-test"></a>The Big Test</h2>

<p>With the above, and many other optimizations, we felt confident in what we
delivered and in a late-night test run, our client was ecstatic. We were
running seven hundred transactions per second, almost twenty times faster than
when we started. It was time for our first production run, using beefier
servers and a much faster network.</p>

<p>It was a disaster. As you may recall, the client had been migrating from
Oracle to PostgreSQL. The QA servers were far less powerful than the
production servers, but they were running PostgreSQL. The production servers
were running Oracle. Oracle is the fast, beastly sports car that will quickly
outpace that Honda Accord you're driving ... so long as the sports car has an
expert driver, regular maintenance, and a highly trained pit crew to look
after it.</p>

<p>Out of the box, PostgreSQL just tends to be fast. Often companies find that
a single PostgreSQL DBA working with competent developers is enough to easily
handle their traffic. But we had Oracle. And it wasn't going away before the
deadline. Time was running out and twenty times faster wasn't fast enough.</p>

## Overview

Increase the performance of Business Transactions from 25-30/sec to 500+/sec.

## Solutions Implemented

The overall implemented solution could not change the outward facing API calls
as end users of the service were not to be impacted by backend changes. The
solution could also not effect the traditional processing as clients would
be issuing both traditional and streamlined transactions.

### New Caching Architecture

Implement a new redundant shared caching architecture using Redis as a data
store, to replace the existing on application server memcached instances.

Update existing application code to remove the use of internal application
caches (implemented as hashes), and replace with pre-loaded shared cache
entries.

### Data Storage Performance

Create an additional data storage path that replaces storing intermediate data
in the backend shared database with the shared caching architecture.

Remove the use of a third party provider API call, and replace with a static
table lookup.

### Implement Staged Processing

As data processing in real time is not a requirement, add a data path that
allows for separation of the front end API responses from the third party
backend processing. This allowed for heavy backend processes to be deferred and
processed in smaller batches.

### Process Streamlining

Worked closely with the client to determine which parts of the process are
required during the processing, and which can be bypassed to save overhead.

Code review and clean up. Refactor code base to remove extraneous or ill
performing legacy code.

### Repeatable

The process was re-engineered to be configurable allowing the same pipeline to
be reimplemented for feature events/customer requirement through simple
documented configuration options, while not impacting traditional processing.
