<p>I'll cut right to the chase so you can decide if this worth reading or not.</p>

<p>I'm an American who's lived in Europe (multiple countries) since 2006.  Here
in Europe, in debating what citizenship means, we have a lot of discussion
about our rights and responsibilities.</p>

<p>In the US, we have a lot of discussion about our rights.</p>

<p>That subtle difference changes everything.</p>

<hr />

<p>When I first moved to the UK back in 2006, many British people asked me if I
moved over for political reasons. I responded with three word “Vice President
Blair.” It didn't matter their political views, they invariably laughed.
Without going into the background of that joke, suffice it to say that it
defused a possibly tense conversation about politics. I had moved to Europe
for adventure, not as some grand political gesture.</p>

<p>Here I am, in quarantine in 2020 due to the coronavirus. I'm living in a house
in the south of France, just north of Cannes. I've spent several years in the
UK, just over a year in the Netherlands, and about eight years in France. I've
friends from all over the world—especially Europe—and I've finally come to an
understanding of what civil society means to Europeans. And with that
understanding, as I watch armed Americans protesting on the steps of capital
buildings, demanding—at gunpoint—the right be exposed to a lethal virus, I've
finally come to understand what is broken with the United States.</p>

<p><figure class="image">

<p>I was born in the US. I was raised in the US. I was a military brat and I still
love my country. This is not a blog post saying that America sucks or that
it's a failed state. There are still many wonderful things about the US, but
it's broken. It's been broken for a long time.</p>

<p><figure class="captioned">

<p>When children at Sandy Hook were murdered and the collective response was
“dead children are the price you pay for freedom,” the world looked on in
horror. In 2017, when a white supremacist neo-Nazi drove his car into a crowd
of protesters in Charlottesville, President Trump <em>still</em> couldn't bring
himself to say “Nazis are evil.” And the world looked on in horror. <a href="https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/reports/mass-shooting" target="_blank">The US is
averaging a mass shooting almost every
day</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> and no one
cares. Peoplea are getting gunned down <em>daily</em> in mass shootings in the United
states but top news stories are explaining <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/04/trump-bleach-coronavirus/610690/" target="_blank">why you shouldn't drink
bleach</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.
A few years ago we laughed about the Idiocracy and now we cry about it.</p>

<p>In 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, we currently have over 50,000 dead
Americans and various state governments, given a <em>complete</em> lack of direction
from the federal government, are trying to institute social distancing and
quarantines with limited success. Then we see armed white men protesting
outside of state capitals because they can't visit Starbucks and they're
laughing like they're at a family barbecue. Americans are dying, people are
panicking, and armed men show up at state capitals to intimidate the
government. Who thought this was a good idea?</p>

<p>And how did we get this broken?</p>

<p>It's watching those men brandishing their weapons, reminding us that we “have
a right to bear arms”, that I finally had the core problem with America sink
home.</p>

<p>Here in Europe, we have a lot of discussion about our rights and
responsibilities as citizens.</p>

<p>In the US, we have a lot of discussion about our rights.</p>

<p>The US is fundamentally a selfish nation.</p>

<h1>Libertarians</h1>

<p><figure class="captioned-left">
    <img src="/static/images/ayn_rand.jpg" width="600" alt="A photo of Ayn Rand">
    <figcaption>Ayn Rand <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ayn_Rand_by_Talbot_1943.jpg" target="_blank">Source</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span></figcaption>
</figure></p>

<p>Now you might be offended by the suggestions that the US is a selfish nation,
but Ayn Rand had a huge influence on US political thought and in 1964, she
published <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Virtue_of_Selfishness" target="_blank">The Virtue of
Selfishness</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, arguing
that it's OK to be “in it for yourself.” It gives a thin veneer of
intellectualism to the “fuck you, I got mine” attitude that is so rampant in
America today.</p>

<p>Rand wrote her book to help explain her philosophy of Objectivism and
Libertarians, while strenously denying being Objectivists (Objectivism touches
on many philosophical areas that Libertarians ignore), nonetheless have
selfish down to a science. <a href="https://www.cato.org/blog/how-many-libertarians-are-there-answer-depends-method" target="_blank">And Libertarians comprise between 10% to 20% of
the US
electorate</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>,
depending on exactly how you choose your definitions.<a href="#1" class="popup-btn"> <span class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></span></a>
<span id="1" class="popup">
  <a href="#1-return" class="close">&times;</a>
  <span class="popup-body">As for
this definition of 'Libertarian', I'm using the right-Libertarian models so
prevalent in the US. In particular, the Minarchists and the
anarcho-Capitalists.</span>
</span>
<a href="#1-return" class="close-popup"></a></p>

<p>And even those who deny being Libertarians are, of course, hugely influenced
by the US ideals of limited government and individual liberty. And honestly,
many Americans really like Libertarians. For example, Ron Paul was adored by
many for his constant presidential runs, despite <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/12/the-story-behind-ron-pauls-racist-newsletters/250338/" target="_blank">the virulently racist
newsletters he
published</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>,
including such thoughtful material as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Order was only restored in L.A. [after the Rodney King riots] when it came
  time for the blacks to pick up their welfare checks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or the lovely: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Given the inefficiencies of what DC laughingly calls the criminal justice
  system, I think we can safely assume that 95 percent of the black males in
  that city are semi-criminal or entirely criminal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, Paul's writing was just another example of a well-known phenomenon:
<a href="https://www.salon.com/2015/06/10/why_libertarianism_is_so_popular_on_the_right_its_the_last_bastion_of_white_male_dominance/" target="_blank">Libertarians are overwhelmingly white
males</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>
from wealthy countries and are <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-insidious-libertarian-to-alt-right-pipeline" target="_blank">their members are frequently
racist</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.<a href="#2" class="popup-btn"> <span class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></span></a>
<span id="2" class="popup">
  <a href="#2-return" class="close">&times;</a>
  <span class="popup-body">There are many who defend Paul, claiming that he wasn't the
author of those particular passages. Except that these newsletters were
published for <em>years</em>. Either Paul knew and approved of the racist
content, or he was so incompetent that he couldn't even run a newsletter, much
less a country.</span>
</span>
<a href="#2-return" class="close-popup"></a>
 And Ron Paul's son, Senator Rand Paul, who also has a
history suggesting he may not be entirely unprejudiced, <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/04/rand-paul-testy-reporters-newsletter/" target="_blank">simply doesn't want
to answer any questions about those
newsletters</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.</p>

<p><figure class="image">
    <img src="/static/images/colored-people-fountain.jpg" width="600" alt="A black man drinking at a fountain with a sign that reads "Reserved for colored people"">
    <figcaption>Rand Paul sees no legal problem with this. <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/%22Colored%22_drinking_fountain_from_mid-20th_century_with_african-american_drinking.jpg" target="_blank">Source</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span></figcaption>
</figure></p>

<p>And at the heart of the matter is when Ron Paul said <a href="https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/161217-paul-says-he-would-have-opposed-civil-rights-act" target="_blank">he would not have voted
for the 1964 Civil Rights
Act</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>
and his son, Rand Paul, kept refusing to answer questions about that, too.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/civil-rights-act" target="_blank">the 1964 Civil Rights
Act</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, amongst
other things it ended the legal practice of segregation and put it place laws
to ban many forms of discrimination, including racial. Today, most Americans
accept it as a given that racial discrimination should be outlawed. But not
all Americans. And it's not even that those Americans are necessarily racist,
but they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100523002921/https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2010/05/20/rand-paul-taking-heat-for-civil-rights-act-comments/" target="_blank">have similar views as Rand
Paul</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I’m not in favor of any discrimination of any form. I would never belong to
  any club that excluded anybody for race,” Paul said on Maddow’s program. But
  when pressed on whether he supported aspects of what the Civil Rights law
  did, including desegregating lunch counters in privately owned restaurants,
  Paul gave a dodge-y answer: “Does the owner of the restaurant own his
  restaurant? Or does the government own his restaurant? These are important
  philosophical debates but not a very practical discussion.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, Paul feels we have rights, but doesn't give much thought to
our responsibilities. He and Libertarians like him are part of the disease
infecting America. Their “me, me, me" attitude is destroying the US. And the
Republican party is largely in line with the Libertarians, just not as
extreme.</p>

<p>More to the point, we can read the <a href="https://www.lp.org/platform/" target="_blank">Libertarian Party
Platform</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> to understand just how much the
Libertarian philosophy loves rights and denies responsibilities. You can read
it for yourself. It's insane, but <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/02/25/overton-window-explained-definition-meaning-217010" target="_blank">Overton
Window</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>
has shifted so far to the right since the days of Reagan that previously solid
Republicans would not be electable in today's environment.</p>

<p>For example, in the early 70s, <a href="https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/richard-nixon-and-the-rise-of-american-environmentalism" target="_blank">Republican and Democrat politicians fought to
present themselves as
environmentalists</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Rights_Amendment" target="_blank">Equal Rights Amendment has wide bi-partison
support</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. And President
Nixon, while never publicly calling for a total ban on handguns, nonetheless
<a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2013/03/gun-control-richard-nixon-wished-for-total-handgun-ban-088686" target="_blank">supported such a
ban</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.
In fact, in 1967, <a href="https://www.history.com/news/black-panthers-gun-control-nra-support-mulford-act" target="_blank">California Governor Ronald Reagan, with the <em>full support
of the NRA</em>, passed the Mulford Act, a sweeping restriction of gun
rights</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.
(Though to be fair, the only reason this was passed was because white
politicians realized that black people had guns too.)</p>

<p>So why spend so much time discussing Libertarians? Because they're everywhere.
The Cato Institute, a well-known Libertarian think tank, shows that between 7%
to 22% of Americans identify as Libertarian, though the wide spread depends
greatly on how you identify Libertarians.</p>

<p>This is important because even those who don't identify as Libertarian are
more likely to see these views as socially acceptable simply because they're
so prevalent. This is due to a cognitive bias called the <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/n7bze/" target="_blank">illusory truth
effect</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, a well-known cognitive bias which makes
us more likely to believe in an idea if we've heard it before. Or just
consider the famous <a href="https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/joseph-goebbels-on-the-quot-big-lie-quot" target="_blank">Joseph Goebbels quote on the big
lie</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually
  come to believe it. The lie can be maintained only for such time as the
  State can shield the people from the political, economic and/or military
  consequences of the lie. It thus becomes vitally important for the State to
  use all of its powers to repress dissent, for the truth is the mortal enemy
  of the lie, and thus by extension, the truth is the greatest enemy of the
  State.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sadly, this works. I get to see this first hand all the time. I was recently
speaking to a deeply conservative relative in the US and the discussion turned
to health. He mentioned something about how terrible the wait times for
medical care must be in France. He had bought in to the “big lie” that medical
care in Europe is terrible.</p>

<p>This same relative, back in 2006, upon learning I was moving from the US to
work for a company in the UK, mentioned that they must be getting me pretty
cheap. After all, immigrants work for less and take jobs from natives. Again,
the “big lie” at work.</p>

<p>Don't get me wrong, they're a great person and you'd probably like them if you
got to know them, but we don't discuss politics. And that's a shame because
the US has gotten divided in terms of left versus right that I hear more and
more of my friends lamenting that they've lost friends over this, or they have
relatives they can't talk to any more over this. All because the right-wing in
America demands their rights while denying their responsibilities.</p>

<p>Or as one of my Libertarian childhood friends now says,  “to me, individual
freedom always takes precedent over any perceived responsibility to other
people.”</p>

<p>And that attitude, right there, is why America is falling apart. It's nothing
more than pure, adolescent selfishness.</p>

<p>It's the three-year old child screaming “me, me, me.”</p>

<p>It's the right-wing “fuck you, I got mine” attitude of so much of America.</p>

<p>It's the redneck philosopher, driving down roads paid for with public dollars,
enjoying an economy built on the strength of public education, to his farm in
the middle of nowhere but with electricity provided via the publicly funded
Rural Electrification Act, fondling his rifle and wiping his mouth with the
flag while proclaiming “Ahm uh self-made man and I don't own nobody nuthin'.”</p>

<p>That's why America has fallen so far. They've taken the easy road. They've taken
the lazy, selfish way out and act as if it's a virtue.</p>

<p>Nobody seems to really care about data</p>
