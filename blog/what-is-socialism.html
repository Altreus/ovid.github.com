<p>Today, on Facebook—words which invariably signal idiocy is about to follow—a
friend of a friend was <em>livid</em> that his personal definition of socialism
wasn’t accepted as a universal definition:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The government owns and controls the means of production; personal property
  is sometimes allowed, but only in the form of consumer goods.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because his personal definition wasn’t accepted, he couldn’t create strawmen
arguments to knock down, nor could he meaningfully engage in debate because,
<em>gosh</em>, it was simply unacceptable that the definition he just Googled wasn’t
good enough for the other debate participants.</p>

<p><figure class="image">
    <img src="/static/images/la-rochelle.jpg" width="600" alt="An old, medieval looking port overlooking a harbor.">
    <figcaption>The Old Port of La Rochelle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Rochelle#/media/File:Vieux_Port_De_La_Rochelle_C%C3%B4t%C3%A9_Ville_(223237923).jpeg" target="_blank">Source</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span></figcaption>
</figure></p>

<p>Except that this definition, for what it’s worth, is the one that is largely
accepted today in the US. Meanwhile, in La Rochelle, a lovely medieval town on
the West coast of France (one in which I used to live), they’re expanding the
harbor to provide better services to billionaire’s super-yachts. It’s
<em>socialists</em> who voted to do so because La Rochelle is undeniably a socialist
town. Turns out the socialists here in France often have no issue with private
property or money, but they strongly object to the abuse of either.</p>

<p>So what gives? Do socialists agree that private property is OK or that it
should be abolished? Can’t have it both ways, can you?</p>

<h1><a name="summary"></a>Summary</h1>

<p>Because, sadly, modern people’s attention spans for reading are short, I’ll
share the definition of socialism now and you can decide if you’re continue reading or not.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Socialism” is a political or economic system that promotes social welfare.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s it. And it’s not exclusionary. If we look at the social democracies
known as the Nordic Model, they are very pro-capitalist and promote business
welfare, too.</p>

<p>So how do we get from government controlling the means of production to this
definition? That takes a bit of explaining.</p>

<h1><a name="history"></a>History</h1>

<p>You can’t have a meaningful discussion of the meaning of socialism unless you
understand the origin of the idea. And no, Karl Marx didn’t come up with it.
His most famous work, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_Kapital" target="_blank">Das
Kapital</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, was published in 1867,
but it was fifty years earlier, possibly with the publications of work by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Owen" target="_blank">Robert Owen</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, that socialism was
gaining traction. However, you can’t appreciate this without the context.</p>

<p><figure class="captioned">
    <img src="/static/images/adam-smith-the-muir-portrait.jpg" width="600" alt="A painting of Adam Smith">
    <figcaption>Adam Smith <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith#/media/File:Adam_Smith_The_Muir_portrait.jpg" target="_blank">Source</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span></figcaption>
</figure></p>

<p>In 1776, Adam Smith published <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wealth_of_Nations" target="_blank">The Wealth of
Nations</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, a book today
regarded as one of the first books describing modern economics. And honestly,
it had to be. The foundations of modern economics are land, labor, and
capital. Historically, land wasn’t freely bought and sold. It was largely held
by nobility who would no more think of selling their ancestral properties than
you would think of selling your parents.</p>

<p>The concept of laborers freely seeking the best possible wage also didn’t
exist. Most people were serfs, tradesmen, clergy, or nobility. Fiefs, lands to
which serfs were tied, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/feudalism" target="_blank">still existed in the 17th
century</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. And utilizing capital to
leverage your wealth to build even more wealth wasn’t really a thing because
modern economic thought was, well, not thought of. In fact, the innovative
possibilities of capital combined with profit-seeking labor is very much a
modern invention.</p>

<p>Adam Smith came along when economies were transitioning from zero-sum
Mercantalism to industrialized capitalism. With the birth of the industrial
revolution in the mid-1700s, we started to see a magnificent growth in
profits. We also saw a magnificent growth in new forms of human misery. In the
paper entitled <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2566252?origin=JSTOR-pdf" target="_blank">Time and Work in 18th-Century
London</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, Hans-Joachim
Voth cites Herman Freudenberger and Gaylord Cummins as arguing that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>annual labor input possibly increased from less than 3,000 to more than
  4,000 hours per adult male between 1750 and 1800.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s up to twice the hours most Americans work today (and Americans tend to
work far more hours than most other developed nations).</p>

<p><figure class="captioned">
    <img src="/static/images/child-labor.jpg" width="600" alt="A young child working in a textile mill">
    <figcaption>Child Labor <a href="https://www.historycrunch.com/child-labor-in-the-industrial-revolution.html#/" target="_blank">Source</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span></figcaption>
</figure></p>

<p>And frequently those laborers were children. It appears that <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/revealed-industrial-revolution-was-powered-by-child-slaves-2041227.html" target="_blank">many children
were effectively slaves during the industrial
revolution</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.
And by “slaves”, I mean that with all of the horrifying implications. Robert
Heilbroner wrote in his famous economic history <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Worldly-Philosophers-Economic-Thinkers-Seventh/dp/068486214X" target="_blank">The Worldly
Philosophers</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>
wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Indeed, a recital of the conditions that prevailed in those early days of
  factory labor is so horrendous that it makes a modern reader’s hair stand on
  end. In 1828, The Lion, a radical magazine of the times, published the
  incredible history of Robert Blincoe, one of eighty pauper-children sent off
  to a factory at Lowdham. The boys and girls—they were all about ten years
  old—were whipped day and night, not only for the slightest fault, but to
  stimulate their flagging industry. And compared with a factory at Litton where
  Blincoe was subsequently transferred, conditions at Lowdham were rather
  humane. At Litton the children scrambled with the pigs for the slops in a
  trough; they were kicked and punched and sexually abused.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sadly, these accounts of the horrors of child labor during the industrial
revolution are not scarce. Is it any wonder that many people objected to the
idea of capitalism?</p>

<p>One of the most prominent objectors was the aforementioned Robert Owen. A
highly successful businessman, Owen was aghast at how workers were treated and
decided to buck collective wisdom and create a more humane business. <a href="http://www.robert-owen.com/" target="_blank">In 1799,
he purchased New Lanark Mills </a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> and </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Under Robert Owen’s management from 1800 to 1825, the cotton mills and
  village of New Lanark became a model community, in which the drive towards
  progress and prosperity through new technology of the Industrial Revolution
  was tempered by a caring and humane regime. This gained New Lanark an
  international reputation for the social and educational reforms Owen
  implemented. New Lanark had the first Infant School in the world, a creche for
  working mothers, free medical care, and a comprehensive education system for
  children, including evening classes for adults. Children under 10 were not
  allowed to work in the Mill.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And Heilbroner reports that from 1815 to 1825, there were over 20,000
visitors, including nobility and business owners, all trying to figure out how
this mill had become hugely profitable.</p>

<p>Owen, along with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_de_Saint-Simon" target="_blank">Henri de
Saint-Simon</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Fourier" target="_blank">Charles
Fourier</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, and others, formed
what we today call the “Utopian Socialists.” Generally speaking, they were a
reaction to the brutality of the industrial revolution and these thinkers
envisioned better worlds, or utopias, based on decency, kindness, and social
needs. However, with the possible exception of Owen’s direct action in New
Lanark, these were imagined worlds, built on dreams, not evidence.</p>

<p>They were, however, the first socialists, they were all over the map, and they
had little to do with governments controlling the means of production.</p>

<p>In contrast to them were the <a href="https://libcom.org/files/ricardian%20socialists.pdf" target="_blank">Ricardian
Socialists</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. They focused
quite heavily on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_theory_of_value" target="_blank">labor theory of
value</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> which argues that
the value of a good or service is the total amount of labor required to
produce it. Yes, many people think that’s Marxist because Marx was quite fond
of it, but their beloved Adam Smith championed it! In Chapter V of <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/3300/3300-0.txt" target="_blank">Wealth of
Nations</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, he wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The value of any commodity, therefore, to the person who possesses it, and
  who means not to use or consume it himself, but to exchange it for other
  commodities, is equal to the quantity of labour which it enables him to
  purchase or command. Labour therefore, is the real measure of the exchangeable
  value of all commodities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Ricardian’s (so-called because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo" target="_blank">David
Ricardo</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> also accepted the labor
theory of value) argued that because value is derived from labor, those who
labor deserve the rewards. This is curious to me because it often implies that
managers and owners who supervise and direct physical labor—often without
doing it themselves—are somehow less valuable, but I digress.</p>

<p>To the Ricardians, labor should reap the rewards of commerce, but is instead
exploited. One of these was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hodgskin" target="_blank">Thomas
Hodgskin</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> and the opening
paragraph from Wikipedia sums up many issues quite nicely (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thomas Hodgskin (12 December 1787 – 21 August 1869) was an English socialist
  writer on political economy, critic of capitalism and defender of free trade
  and early trade unions. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, <strong>the term
  socialist included any opponent of capitalism</strong>, at the time defined as a
  construed political system built on privileges for the owners of capital</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For Hodgskin, capitalism was built and maintained to serve the privileged
class. However, he didn’t object capitalism <em>per se</em>. He objected to what we
might call <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crony_capitalism" target="_blank">crony capitalism</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.
He didn’t want a world where one prevailed due to government meddling and
restrictions; he was, in fact, a Libertarian who loved the market system, but
championed labor. He insisted on the rights of unions to exist and advocate
for workers (because which Libertarian would object to free association?) and
he strongly objected to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent-seeking" target="_blank">rent seeking
behavior</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. But he was definitely a
capitalist, through and through. And a socialist in that he advocated for the
needs of society, not just the monied class.</p>

<h1><a name="marx"></a>Marx</h1>

<p><figure class="captioned">
    <img src="/static/images/karl-marx.jpg" width="600" alt="A photograph of Karl Marx">
    <figcaption>Karl Marx <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx#/media/File:Karl_Marx_001.jpg" target="_blank">Source</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span></figcaption>
</figure></p>

<p>It wasn’t until Karl Marx came along and skewered the Utopian and Ricardian
socialists, that people started associated socialism with Marx’s much more
limited view. This was, in part, because Das Kapital, The Communist Manifesto,
and other writings to Marx and Engels both acknowledged the moral
considerations of the Utopian and Ricardian socialists, and skewered them for
being fantasies (and for many other reasons, not the least of which was that
Marx could’t understand that persuasive speech could bring substantial
change—he demanded revolution).</p>

<p>In particular, in <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/download/pdf/Manifesto.pdf" target="_blank">The Communist
Manifesto</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>
Marx wrote of the Utopian socialists:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By degrees, they sink into the category of the reactionary [or] conservative
  Socialists depicted above, differing from these only by more systematic
  pedantry, and by their fanatical and superstitious belief in the miraculous
  effects of their social science.</p>
  
  <p>They, therefore, violently oppose all political action on the part of the
  working class; such action, according to them, can only result from blind
  unbelief in the new Gospel. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>But what of his own views? In the Manifesto, Communism is the inevitable
result, but socialism is a necessaary step:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We have seen above, that the first step in the revolution by the
  working class is to raise the proletariat to the position of ruling
  class to win the battle of democracy. The proletariat will use its
  political supremacy to wrest, by degree, all capital from the
  bourgeoisie, to centralise all instruments of production in the hands
  of the State, i.e., of the proletariat organised as the ruling
  class; and to increase the total productive forces as rapidly as
  possible. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And that is effectively the definition that many hurl against socialism today:
naïve workers gutting honest, hard-working, private enterprise in favor of an
inefficient nanny state. Or to phrase it in the other extreme: the proletariat
rising up against the bourgeoisie to put power in the hands of the people.</p>

<p>Personally, I don’t buy either definition because a) I don’t see it happening
and b) I can’t help but roll my eyes at those those think the definition of an
ever-evolving word must be set in stone by an essay written 172 years ago,
ignoring all modern thought on the subject.</p>

<h1><a name="words-mean-things"></a>Words Mean Things</h1>

<p>And then they mean other things. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jan/22/english-language-america-australia" target="_blank">For
example</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Girl meant any young person – “gay girl” meant girl, not lesbian, and
  “knave girl” meant boy – while “man” meant any person, regardless of gender.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We think “girl” arrived in the English language <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/girl" target="_blank">around 1300
CE</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, but we’re not certain of its
origin.</p>

<p>Or consider the word “meat”, coming from the Old English <em>maet</em>, <a href="http://etymologynow.blogspot.com/2011/09/etymology-of-meat.html" target="_blank">simply meant
“food”</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> and
its current definition of “animal flesh” didn’t arrive until the 1300s. </p>

<p>Words, of course, have no intrinsic meaning. When I hear the word “peer”, I
think something like “equal in quality”, but if I’m speaking French, the same
<em>sound</em> means “worst.”<a href="#1" class="popup-btn"> <span class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></span></a>
<span id="1" class="popup">
  <a href="#1-return" class="close">&times;</a>
  <span class="popup-body">To my horror, I used to think that the
French word « pire » mean ’best’, leading to some confusing conversations.</span>
</span>
<a href="#1-return" class="close-popup"></a>
 Instead, words have the meaning we ascribe to them and nothing more. But
this causes many problems if we don’t understand that another’s definition is
different from our own. For example, some people think “meat” means pork or
beef, leading to ridiculous incidents of vegetarians being served chicken
because they “don’t eat meat.”</p>

<p>So if you have a definition of socialism that doesn’t match my own and we
don’t realize this, it’s very easy to have a confused argument. So what do
people think socialism means today?</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://news.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/243362/meaning-socialism-americans-today.aspx" target="_blank">2018 Gallup poll of
Americans</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>:</p>

<table>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>2018</td><td>1949</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Sep 4-12</td><td>Sep 3-8</td></tr>
<tr><td>Equality - equal standing for everybody, all equal in rights, equal in distribution</td><td>23%</td><td>12%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Government ownership or control, government ownership of utilities, everything controlled by the government, state control of business</td><td>17%</td><td>34%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Benefits and services - social services free, medicine for all</td><td>10%</td><td>2%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Modified communism, communism</td><td>6%</td><td>6%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Talking to people, being social, social media, getting along with people</td><td>6%</td><td>--</td></tr>

<tr><td>Derogatory opinions (non-specific)</td><td>6%</td><td>2%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Other</td><td>8%</td><td>7%</td></tr>
<tr><td>No opinion</td><td>23%</td><td>36%</td></tr>
</table>

<p>It’s interesting to note that “government control” has now slipped to second
place between “equality” and “benefits and services.”</p>

<p>And then we have this lovely New Yorker article discussing <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/the-many-tangled-american-definitions-of-socialism" target="_blank">how tangled the
definition of socialism
is in America today</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.</p>

<h1><a name="the-nordic-model"></a>The Nordic Model</h1>

<p>And then there’s <a href="https://economics.mit.edu/files/5726" target="_blank">the Nordic Model</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.
The social democracies which have adopted the Nordic model have strongly
embraced globalization, capitalism, and social welfare. While they differ in
varying degrees, key similarities in all of these countries include:</p>

<ul>
<li>a comprehensive welfare state </li>
<li>large-scale public and/or private spending on investment in human capital,
including child car and education</li>
<li>labour market institutions that include strong labour unions and employer associations</li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on where you want to draw the line, the countries which follow the
Nordic model are Finland, Denmark, and Sweden. Many count Norway and Iceland
in that group. These countries tend to have strong economies and, most
importantly, <a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/happiest-countries-in-the-world" target="_blank">five out of the seven happiest countries in the
world</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>
follow the Nordic model.</p>

<p>And given the historical definitions of socialism, I think the social
democracy of the Nordic Model fits quite well.</p>
